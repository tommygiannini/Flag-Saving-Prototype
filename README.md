This flag saving prototype is designed to be used in bigger projects that need some way of saving flags or other data. It staves different datapoints in different lines, so it can be used to store and retrieve values such as numbers and bools.
There are currently 4 functions: changeInFile, which changes a certain line in a file (parameters: string fileLocation, int lineToChange, string newData), readLineFromFile, which does what it says (parameters: string fileLocation, int lineToRead), makeNewFile, which make an empty file in a directory that already exists (parameters: string fileLocation), and makeFileInDirectory, which makes an empty file in a directory that doesn't have to already exist (parameters: string fileLocation).
Keep in mind you need to double all the backslaches (\\) in file paths because the compiler treats those different than normal characters.
